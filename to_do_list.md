TO DO:
Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.  
*Merge all files and adjust all python scripts to pull from one file rather than multiple
-Adjust functions after this to pull from new file rather than separate files (join on employee name)

*Make at least 1 Pandas pivot table and 1 matplotlib/seaborn plot. Pivot tables are a way to summarize your data and present it easily in a way that isnâ€™t just a graph. They can be useful when combined with graphs.

*Create virtual environment and install all packages used in python testing
